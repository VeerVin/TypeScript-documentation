// Interfaces:

/** 
 * An interface is a syntactical contract that an entity should conform to. In other words, 
 * an interface defines the syntax that any entity must adhere to.
 * 
 * By defining an interface we are defining the shape of the object, the type of value each property
 * will have. We can say it is custom type, which is created by you :)
 * 
 * So that we dont pass a number type instead of an string type.
*/

// For an example:

function drawPoint(point){
    point.x;
    point.y;
}

drawPoint({
    x: 10,
    y: 20
});

/**
 * In the above example we are passing an object which is having required properties to draw
 * a point. But what if we pass string to 'x' and 'y' properties? our draPoint function code will break. 
 * Becuase it wants integer type to draw the point not string type. So what is the solution?
 * 
 * There are two ways to solve this problem one way is to use inline annotations and other is using Interfaces
 */

// Inline annotations

function drawPoints(point: {x: number, y: number}){
    point.x;
    point.y;
}

drawPoint({
    x: 10,
    y: 20
});

/**
 * So in the above example we are adding type annotations to the parameter telling which type of value the 
 * object parameter should contain. This is called inline annotations.
 * 
 * It looks fine for simple cases, but the problem with this is it is verbose and what if we have lot of
 * properties in our object defining its type in parameter again and again is an headache.
 * 
 * What if another function is accepting the same pramters passed a object with same type? we
 * have to write it again.
 * 
 * To solve this problem we can use Interfaces in TypeScript
 */

// Using Interface

interface Points {
    x: number;
    y: number;
}

function drawPointss(point: Points){
    point.x;
    point.y;
}

drawPointss({
    x: 30,
    y: 50
});

/**
 * So in the above interface we are defining the shape and type fo the value the object properties
 * will store and then we are passing it to function parameters to tell the type of value the
 * parameter will be holding.
 * 
 * In this code 'point: Points' interface is informaing the function what type of value the paramter
 * holds.
 * 
 * Note: While naming interface always use pascal naming convection, by that I mean the 
 * starting letter of name should be cpaital.
 */

// Simple Example:

function printLabel(labelObj: {label: string}) {
    console.log(labelObj.label); // print: 'Hello!'
}

let printObj = {size: 10, label: 'Hello!'};

printLabel(printObj);

/**
 * In the above example function 'printLabel' is having one parameter which requires the object
 * which is passed to it have property 'label' of type 'string'.
 * 
 * Notice that the object which is passed to the function have more than one poperty. But the compiler
 * only checks if it have the property which the parameter is looking for. In our case 'label'.
 * 
 * So the result of the above code will be: 'Hello!'
 */

// We can write the above example, but this time using interface:

interface printObjVal {
    size: number,
    label: string
}

function printLabels(labelObj: printObjVal){
    console.log(labelObj.label); // print: Hello!
    console.log(labelObj.size); // print: 10
}

let printObjs = {size: 10, label: 'Hello!'};

printLabels(printObjs); // printObj is decalred in line no: 14, which is passed here

/**
 * The only change between this example using 'interface' and the above example is, the interface
 * 'printObjVal' is the requirement which we need. By that we mean, the values which we want to print
 * is now added into interface 'printObjVal' and that is passed to the function.
 * 
 * Itâ€™s worth pointing out that the type checker does not require that these properties come 
 * in any sort of order, only that the properties the interface requires are present and 
 * have the required type.
 * 
 * If you remove 'size' property from 'printObj' Object, then the above code will not work.
 * Because interface 'printObjVal' understand/looking that 'size' and 'label' are passed as parameters
 * to 'printObj' object.
 * 
 * So in interface you can add only the properties which you need from object, 
 * But you can't add extra properties, it will throw error.
 * 
 * To solve the above issue you can add '?' after the interface property name.
 * Check below example: 
 */

interface SquareConfig {
    color?: string;
    width?: number;
}

function createSquare(config: SquareConfig): {color: string; area: number} {
    let newSquare = {color: "white", area: 100};
    if (config.color) {
        newSquare.color = config.color;
    }

    if (config.width) {
        newSquare.area = config.width * config.width;
    }
    return newSquare;
}

let mySquare = createSquare({ color: "black" });

/**
 * By Adding '?' after the interface property name, the property name becomes optional by that 
 * we mean that if you dont pass either color or width to the function 'createSquare' it wll not throw error
 * and the output will be '{color: "white", area: 100}'
 * 
 * if you pass only '{ color: "black" }' to the function then the output will be: {color: "black", area: 100}
